# quillio

This repository is used for storing documents necessary for project planning and CS307 grading submission, and will hold the code base. 

The weekly team reports will be stored here as well. All individual weekly reports will be stored under documents/<team-member> directories and should be pushed to master each week. 

## Development

To run the application locally, you can run the command:
`heroku local`

For database connections, you will have to set the environment variable locally to the connection string found in the heroku dashboard.
`export MONGODB_URI=some://connectionstring.that.is.awesome850938509238590`
